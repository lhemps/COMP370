1. Installed MariaDB from this tutorial "https://www.tecmint.com/install-mariadb-in-debian/"
2. Tried following this to the best of my ability "https://mariadb.com/kb/en/configuring-mariadb-for-remote-client-access/"

3. SQL: CREATE DATABASE comp370_test;
4. SQL: CREATE USER 'comp370' IDENTIFIED BY '$ungl@ss3s';
